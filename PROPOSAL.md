# A Scalable Solution for Cross-Blockchain Interoperability

## 1. Introduction


## 2. Problem Statement
-	Finding a link between EOSIO and Ethereum blockchains to ultimately scale both chains and improve the development time of decentralized applications.


## 3. Objectives
-	Explore the Ethereum yellow paper, EOS white paper, and any additional resources with the purpose of understanding key steps that need to be taken in order to build this "bridge" between blockchain platforms.
Immediate Plan:
- Use EOSIO and Ethereum development platforms to create transactions and push code on the EOS and Ethereum blockchains. This way we get a hands-on look at how the blockchain environment in both platforms behaves.
- Push Ethereum contracts from the EOS blockchain through an Ethereum Virtual Machine.

## 4. Preliminary Literature Review

As of right now, the popular method of linking blockchains is through the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This allows existing blockchains to connect and push transitions to only the Ethereum blockchain. A good example of this is the work done by IBM with their Hyper Ledger Fabric. The method produces tremendous results, however, it is not scalable to other blockchains yet. Another company, LiquidLink has developed a solution to connect EOS and Ethereum, but claim for future support for the connection of Bitcoin chains as well. A general solution to connect all the major blockchains seems to be impossible, but handling each major connection seems to be a feasable solution. The reason to connect certain blockchains like EOS to Ethereum is to get efficiency of EOS to be used with Ethereum and allow for general dApp solutions that can push to multiple blockchains. The question of efficiency of the bridging process becomes extremely important as if implemented wrong can defeat its own purpose. This paper will take a look at the existing models and analyze which are more efficient and what truly is the best way to make these connections. This area is hotly researched which is evident by various bounties on connecting the chains. For instance a challenge to connect EOS and Ethereum has been issued and many are attempting to solve the problem.
