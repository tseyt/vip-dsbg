# Report

## The Current Problem:
-	Finding a link between EOSIO and Ethereum blockchains to ultimately scale both chains and improve the development time of decentralized applications.


## Our Goal:
-	Explore the Ethereum yellow paper, EOS white paper, and any additional resources with the purpose of understanding key steps that need to be taken in order to build this "bridge" between blockchain platforms.

## Immediate Plan:
- Use EOSIO and Ethereum development platforms to create transactions and test them on the EOS and Ethereum blockchains.
