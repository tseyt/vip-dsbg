# 3/16 Meeting Dr. Chong Li on vipdsbg Project Proposal

## Two Major Problems for Cross-Blockchain Compatibility
- Different consensus algorithms
- Different underlying structures - ie blockchain based or DAG based

## 5 Major Use Cases for Blockchains
- Payment
- Asset transfer aka portable assets
- Cross-chain oracle 
- Asset deposit/ encumberance
- Smart contracts

## Dr. Chong Li Suggestions
- Perform a comprehensive literature review of cross-blockchain projects (and blockchain protocols???) *******
- Has not been done yet before!
- Look at the interledger by ripple project, cosmos project
- Do not rush. Be systematic and do it right
- White papers are introductions to blockchain ecosystems, yellow papers are more like technical papers

## Other
* Storage problem
	* Has nothing to do with us but Dr. Chong Li is working on it and it is very interesting and important
	* As the size of a ledger exponentially increases (imaginable if blockchain takes off and becomes popularly used), few computer systems can actually store a copy of the entire ledger. The only entities that could would be Microsoft/Google type corporations, which defeats the whole decentralization purpose.
	* So how do we also fairly and securely distribute the storage of the ledger?
