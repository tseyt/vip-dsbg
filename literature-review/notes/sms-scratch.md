# Systematic Mapping Study scratch work

### Potential Research Questions - pick no more than 3 
* What is the state of current IBC projects? -- As in, list them and what they attempt to do
* Where is the information on IBC located?
* What are current research topics on IBC?
* What are current research gaps on IBC?
* Whos is funding/producing IBC research -- this one could get lumped into "where is the info on IBC located", or maybe it deserved its own standalone research question. TBD.

### Places to Look (Databases, etc.)
* IEEE Explore, ACM Digital Library, dblp, ScienceDirect, Springer, Ebsco, Scopus, PLOS One, JSTOR, Web of Science
* We will need to include "grey literature": materials and research produced by organizations outside of the traditional commercial or academic publishing and distribution channels. Common grey literature publication types include reports, working papers, government documents, white papers and evaluations

### Keywords/phrases for search strings
* "inter-blockchain", "inter-blockchain communication", "blockchain", "interoperability", "blockchain interoperability", "distributed ledger", "distributed ledger interoperability", "blockchain communication", "distributed ledger communication", "multiple blockchains", "cross-chain cooperation", "multiple blockchain systems", "
* We're not going to use all of these. We will trim these down to the ones we think will work best for our purposes. For example, we will definitely have "inter-blockchain communication" as a search string, while just the word "blockchain"... probably not so much. In reality, we will want to cheat a little and try out several of these first on databases, and leverage google scholar to get an idea of what phrases work and what exists out there. Then we can definitively settle on a search methodology.
