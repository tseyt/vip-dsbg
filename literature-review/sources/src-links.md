## Basics - for our learning

  * Was looking for SLRs on IBC research and found this. Didn't even mention IBC but it is from 2016...

## Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) Examples and Help
* [A systematic literature review of blockchain cyber security](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcan.2019.01.005) \[Choo\]
  * Great example of what a blockchain SLR looks like, could base ours off this
* [Guideline for SLR in software engineering](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.117.471) \[Kitchenham\]
  * Great thorough guide for writing an SLR
* [Systematic Literature Review in Computer Science - A Practical Guide](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.35453.87524) \[Silva\]
  * More accessible, watered down version of Kitchenham
* [Systematic Mapping Studies in Software Engineering](http://www.robertfeldt.net/publications/petersen_ease08_sysmap_studies_in_se.pdf) \[Petersen\]
  * We might instead want to do a systematic mapping study first - this is the guide to follow.
* [What is a "mapping study"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4722648/) \[Cooper\]

 * Great example of a blockchain related SMS. The author is a PHD student, and the paper is written very simply. I imagine our paper coming out something like this
